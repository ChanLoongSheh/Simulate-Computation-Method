Certainly! Calculating the effective radius in the context of Mie scattering involves understanding the interaction of light with spherical particles. Let’s break it down:

Size Parameter (x):
The size parameter, denoted as (x), is a crucial factor in Mie scattering. It quantifies how the particle size compares to the wavelength of incident light.
It is defined as: [ x = \frac{{2 \pi \cdot \text{{radius}}}}{{\lambda}} ] where:
(\text{{radius}}) is the physical radius of the scattering particle.
(\lambda) is the wavelength of the incident light.
Complex Refractive Index:
The refractive index of the particle is typically complex, with both real and imaginary parts.
The real part ((n)) represents the particle’s optical density, while the imaginary part ((k)) accounts for absorption.
For example, if the refractive index is given as (n + ki), where (i) represents the imaginary unit, use the negative value of (k).
Scattering Efficiency (Q_scat):
The scattering efficiency ((Q_{\text{sca}})) describes how efficiently the particle scatters light relative to its geometrical cross-sectional area.
It can be expressed as: [ Q_{\text{sca}} = \frac{\sigma}{\pi \cdot \text{{radius}}^2} ] where:
(\sigma) is the scattering cross-section.
(\text{{radius}}) is the effective radius (which accounts for the particle’s shape and refractive index).
Effective Radius:
The effective radius is a concept that combines the particle’s size, shape, and refractive properties.
It is not necessarily equal to the physical radius but represents an equivalent sphere that scatters light with similar efficiency.
Calculating the effective radius involves solving for (\text{{radius}}) in the scattering efficiency equation: [ \text{{radius}} = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma}{\pi \cdot Q_{\text{sca}}}} ]
